&lt;p&gt;Just a few days before last Christmas I began belatedly thinking about what sort of things I could do with my family during the holiday period. A little while ago, one of my buddies had introduced me to Kingdomino (&lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino&#34;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino&lt;/a&gt;) which is a fun tile placement game for up to 4 players. It was on &amp;lsquo;the list&amp;rsquo; of games that I had put together after perusing a number of sources on the internet for games that play well with three players. This is because my immediate family unit is made up of me, my wife, and our (currently) 9 year old son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that I was belatedly thinking about it because I started after even Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Christmas delivery cut off. This might be an obstacle for your average fellow, but armed with my 3D printer I was not deterred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I talked about Kingdomino and what the maximum possible score is in two player 7 x 7 grid mode is (&lt;a href=&#34;http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-14-ultimate-king-domino/&#34;&gt;http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-14-ultimate-king-domino/&lt;/a&gt;). I showed a possible contender (267 points) and asked whether you could do better, throwing down the gauntlet. Well I picked the gauntlet back up again and did better myself.&lt;/p&gt;
