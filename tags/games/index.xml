Back at the beginning of the academic year, we were all geared up to run the Festival of Daring and Excitement. However, upon arriving at the University the day of the event, I discovered that all the doors to the building were taped off and a strictly no entry sign was stuck to the doors. Cue me rushing around like a lunatic trying to find out what happened, and telling as many people as quickly as possible that we would have to cancel the event and try again another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Global Game Jam was back this weekend just passed. This year the theme was Roots. There was a modest turnout, but games were made and fun (and learning) was had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Another academic year has whizzed by and it always seems to accelerate to a final sprint in the summer. Subsequently, the new year is upon us and we have just finished Induction (Welcome/Fresher&amp;rsquo;s) Week for the 2019/2020 intake. The grand finale to the week is the student&amp;rsquo;s introduction to the Bored? Games! events: The Festival of Daring and Excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a little account of what went on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
