&lt;br/&gt;
I quite like gadgets. So it should come as little surprise that I have been drawn by the bright future promised by smart bulbs. By their nature, in order to retain access to their smart functionality they need to be &amp;lsquo;on&amp;rsquo; even if they are not shining. This presents a problem when faced with several decades of habit of flicking the power switch when you walk in to and out of a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; you can voice control them using Alexa, but that has some faintly annoying lag and that is even if she understands you the first time. Plus, shouting &amp;ldquo;you damn well know what I meant, Alexa!&amp;rdquo; to turn off the bedside light can be disruptive to one&amp;rsquo;s sleeping partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is about the start of my quest to find another way.&lt;/p&gt;
