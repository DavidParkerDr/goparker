Back at the beginning of the academic year, we were all geared up to run the Festival of Daring and Excitement. However, upon arriving at the University the day of the event, I discovered that all the doors to the building were taped off and a strictly no entry sign was stuck to the doors. Cue me rushing around like a lunatic trying to find out what happened, and telling as many people as quickly as possible that we would have to cancel the event and try again another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Global Game Jam was back this weekend just passed. This year the theme was Roots. There was a modest turnout, but games were made and fun (and learning) was had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After a long pandemic hiatus, yesterday saw the return of the Bored? Games! Christmas Bash. Once again collaborating with the student Gaming Society and the Card and Board Game Society. There were mince pies and everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
