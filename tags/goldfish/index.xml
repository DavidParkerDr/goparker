      <description>This game was my first foray into Windows Phone 7 development. It is a Silverlight app based on the card game of Memory (as I knew it, though it is also known by many other names according to Wikipedia). The idea is that you turn over the ‘cards’ in pairs; if they match then you get to keep them. If they don’t match then they are flipped back over and you get another try.</description>
