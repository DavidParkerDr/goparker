      <description>Under a rock and hidden deep,
There lies a frog, heâ€™s half asleep.
He dreams no dreams of kingdoms far,
But of being trapped inside a jar.
&amp;nbsp;
He tossed and turned throughout the night,
Not cold, he shivered from his fright.
The jar was sealed, the air was thin,
Not much air was there within.
&amp;nbsp;
So he gasped and strived for a breath,
And bravely waited for his death.</description>
