&lt;p&gt;So Three Thing Game (&lt;a href=&#34;http://threethinggame.com/post/2018-05-05-the-event/&#34;&gt;http://threethinggame.com/post/2018-05-05-the-event/&lt;/a&gt;) took place last weekend and much fun was had by all. That link was an article I wrote chronicling the event including all the winners. There were a number of other great games made that didn&amp;rsquo;t place and hopefully they will all make their own blog posts about it because this is my blog so I want to talk about the great game that I made.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Just a quick note for now to announce the publishing of our game â€“ Heartotron &amp;#8211; to the Windows Store. You can preview and install it (for free!) on your Windows 8 device from the following store link:

Please give it a go and leave us some feedback or ideas for improvements. We have a planned update for later in the week to add new enemy types so watch this space.</description>
