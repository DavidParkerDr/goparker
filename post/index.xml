      <title>Even More Ultimate King Domino</title>

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I talked about Kingdomino and what the maximum possible score is in two player 7 x 7 grid mode is (&lt;a href=&#34;http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-14-ultimate-king-domino/&#34;&gt;http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-14-ultimate-king-domino/&lt;/a&gt;). I showed a possible contender (267 points) and asked whether you could do better, throwing down the gauntlet. Well I picked the gauntlet back up again and did better myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ultimate King Domino</title>

&lt;p&gt;Just a few days before last Christmas I began belatedly thinking about what sort of things I could do with my family during the holiday period. A little while ago, one of my buddies had introduced me to Kingdomino (&lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino&#34;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino&lt;/a&gt;) which is a fun tile placement game for up to 4 players. It was on &amp;lsquo;the list&amp;rsquo; of games that I had put together after perusing a number of sources on the internet for games that play well with three players. This is because my immediate family unit is made up of me, my wife, and our (currently) 9 year old son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that I was belatedly thinking about it because I started after even Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Christmas delivery cut off. This might be an obstacle for your average fellow, but armed with my 3D printer I was not deterred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Three Thing Game (&lt;a href=&#34;http://threethinggame.com/post/2018-05-05-the-event/&#34;&gt;http://threethinggame.com/post/2018-05-05-the-event/&lt;/a&gt;) took place last weekend and much fun was had by all. That link was an article I wrote chronicling the event including all the winners. There were a number of other great games made that didn&amp;rsquo;t place and hopefully they will all make their own blog posts about it because this is my blog so I want to talk about the great game that I made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent post about blogging and CSBlogs (&lt;a href=&#34;http://goparker.com/post/2018-04-23-csblogs-and-blogging/&#34;&gt;http://goparker.com/post/2018-04-23-csblogs-and-blogging/&lt;/a&gt;) I mentioned that I have been playing around with using the static site generation tool Hugo (&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/&lt;/a&gt;) with GitHub Pages (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;https://pages.github.com/&lt;/a&gt;) as a means of hosting various websites at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I explain how it is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, it was nice for the Three Thing Game and the Bored? Games! events to get some official recognition for the benefits that they provide to the student experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I have been frustrated by a perennial problem of mine which is forgetting to add a crucial file to source control. Consequently, a program that I had wanted to show off today won&amp;rsquo;t build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a post to proselytise the virtues of blogging with respect to getting your first job (and possibly ones to follow). I also want to reintroduce CSBlogs  &lt;a href=&#34;http://csblogs.com/&#34;&gt;http://csblogs.com/&lt;/a&gt; to the Hull Computer Science students. More on both below. The picture is unrelated but begs the question, Who&amp;rsquo;s a pretty tabby tiger?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
A while back I was asked by the digital marketing team whether I would feature in a promotional video for Computer Science and here it is! It speaks to the quality of the answers that I gave to their questions that what you see here is a subset of the whole of my ramblings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Under a rock and hidden deep,
There lies a frog, he’s half asleep.
He dreams no dreams of kingdoms far,
But of being trapped inside a jar.
&amp;nbsp;
He tossed and turned throughout the night,
Not cold, he shivered from his fright.
The jar was sealed, the air was thin,
Not much air was there within.
&amp;nbsp;
So he gasped and strived for a breath,
And bravely waited for his death.</description>

      <description>If you want to get the first fault tree in my ExampleFaultTrees object, then the following code is for you:
var exampleFaultTrees = new ExampleFaultTrees(); topNode = exampleFaultTrees.getFaultTree(0);  You first need to instantiate an ExampleFaultTrees object and then you can ask it for the zeroth element in its internal array of fault trees.
You can then simply call the topNode&amp;#8217;s draw function, giving it the 2d context of the canvas as a parameter to draw to.</description>

      <description>The other day I gave a workshop for the 08240 2d Computer Graphics students in the Computer Science department of the University of Hull. A number of the students were struggling with this aspect of the coursework that they were undertaking.
Above is a rough video I put together of the content. I made it using a chemistry beaker holder to hold my webcam pointing down at the surface of my desk.</description>

      <description>Today I took possession of my shiny new Samsung Galaxy Note II.
My previous daily device was the Samsung Omnia 7 which was one of the debut devices of the Windows Phone 7 range. It was a close run race between the Note II and the flagship Windows Phone 8 device the Nokia Lumia 920.

      <description>This morning, some lovely person using the handle Burger commented on one of my earlier posts suggesting that if I connect the eGPU setup after boot-up is complete then I should get a significant boost due to PCIe compression. I little bit of Googling reveals a bit more detail here, but it seems that you need to have a ‘modern’ Intel integrated GPU in combination with one of a fairly narrow range of Nvidia kit.</description>

      <description>Today my new graphics card arrived from eBay. It is a second hand MSI N460GTX Hawk which I picked up for a reasonable £79.02 including postage. This puts the running total for the eGPU project (not including bits that I had lying around) at £166.10.
  So how does it perform? Well you may remember that I previously benchmarked both the integrated graphics of my laptop and a borrowed Geforce 9600GT in the eGPU adapter with the eGPU providing a splendid 3 times increase in the 3DMark06 score.</description>

      <description>Well, I have done a spot of benchmarking. Specifically using 3DMark06 and the Resident Evil 5 benchmarking tool. If you are wondering what I am talking about here is an introduction and a follow-up.
I guess a brief recap wouldn’t be out of place. I have a laptop with integrated graphics. This severely limits the games that I can play. This makes me sad. I have read that I can put together an adapter that plugs in to the ExpressCard slot in my laptop that allows me to use a desktop GPU to power the graphics.</description>

      <description>Today (26th) the adapter parts for my eGPU project arrived from Taiwan. I paid for it on the 20th via PayPal and on the 24th the PayPal status was updated to let me know that my purchase had shipped with a DHL tracking number. I am pretty happy with the delivery time.
Something that I knew was a possibility, though was still slightly vexing, was an accompanying VAT charge from Customs amounting to £12.</description>

      <description>Though I like to think that my software development work shows a little artistry, I am certainly not an artist in the classical sense of the word. However, I have been developing an art project with artist Roberto Bono (Roberto&amp;#8217;s website) for the past year or so, and as I have just uploaded a couple of new Roberto works I thought I would share them.
The ‘idea’ of the work is that is is comprised of 12 double sided paintings that form the whole.</description>

      <description>Today I spent the day a the Beverley Maze with The Wife, The Boy, and some friends. If you haven’t encountered such a thing before, it is a large maze that has been cut in to a field of growing corn (or maize to identify the pun). In order to add to the challenge and fun of the exploration there are, dotted about the maze, some boards with quiz questions. By collecting the correct answers you can decode the final board at the exit of the maze and enter your self in to their competition.</description>

      <description>This game was my first foray into Windows Phone 7 development. It is a Silverlight app based on the card game of Memory (as I knew it, though it is also known by many other names according to Wikipedia). The idea is that you turn over the &amp;#8216;cards&amp;#8217; in pairs; if they match then you get to keep them. If they don&amp;#8217;t match then they are flipped back over and you get another try.</description>

      <description>The PC that I use for work (and play) is a Toshiba Portégé R700-160 laptop. It is a delightfully sleek and portable device that packs a pretty decent Intel Core i5-520M Processor into its tiny chassis. A (perhaps unavoidable) weakness of the machine is its graphics capability as it relies on the integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD GPU. It can just about manage Civilization V but anything more graphically intensive is a shuddering no-no.</description>

      <description>Today our shiny juicer arrived from eBay. So far we have tried apple and carrot, which was surprisingly nice, and banana and strawberry smoothie.</description>
