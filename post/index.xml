Today I presented a session in our new students induction called &amp;ldquo;Building Your Brand&amp;rdquo; which was broadly about how to develop your profile in a way that supplements everything that you are explicitly learning on your degree programme. In preparing for it I came across something that led me to an interesting diversion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a bit of a while coming, mostly down to the need to generate Mobile Devices content each week. Better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in mid October we once again took part in the UK and Ireland Programming Competition. We fielded teams for the first time last year and this year doubled our entries with 4 teams. Each team can have up to 3 members and are given 1 computer and 0 internets to solve up to 12 secret programming puzzles in just 5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

Another academic year has whizzed by and it always seems to accelerate to a final sprint in the summer. Subsequently, the new year is upon us and we have just finished Induction (Welcome/Fresher&amp;rsquo;s) Week for the 2019/2020 intake. The grand finale to the week is the student&amp;rsquo;s introduction to the Bored? Games! events: The Festival of Daring and Excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a little account of what went on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A little while ago I was designing and printing an update to my printer to allow it to use one less motor for controlling the z-axis. The basic printer design uses two lead screws to raise and lower the x-axis. It still does, but now it only uses one motor to control both screws instead of the original two. But that is not what this post is about. Instead it is about staying cool under circumstances to drive one mad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I quite like gadgets. So it should come as little surprise that I have been drawn by the bright future promised by smart bulbs. By their nature, in order to retain access to their smart functionality they need to be &amp;lsquo;on&amp;rsquo; even if they are not shining. This presents a problem when faced with several decades of habit of flicking the power switch when you walk in to and out of a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; you can voice control them using Alexa, but that has some faintly annoying lag and that is even if she understands you the first time. Plus, shouting &amp;ldquo;you damn well know what I meant, Alexa!&amp;rdquo; to turn off the bedside light can be disruptive to one&amp;rsquo;s sleeping partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is about the start of my quest to find another way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;During induction week this year I put together a lab activity based around Robocode (&lt;a href=&#34;https://robocode.sourceforge.io/)&#34;&gt;https://robocode.sourceforge.io/)&lt;/a&gt;. The students were introduced to it on Wednesday afternoon and had lab slots during Thursday to further refine their creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we got to find out how they all did in an epic showdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have finally got the various bolts required to assemble the electronics in to the PixelBot chassis. So here she is.
I felt that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just keep calling the PixelBot &amp;ldquo;the PixelBot&amp;rdquo;. So her new name is Smiler.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In one of my previous posts on the value of blogging (&lt;a href=&#34;http://goparker.com/post/2018-04-23-csblogs-and-blogging/&#34;&gt;http://goparker.com/post/2018-04-23-csblogs-and-blogging/&lt;/a&gt;) I remarked on how once a random internet stranger had left a comment that substantially improved the performance of the eGPU setup that I was blogging about. That was awesome, and I really think of it warmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also occured to me as I wrote this that the way I had the blog currently setup, using static site generator Hugo (&lt;a href=&#34;http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-08-github-pages-and-hugo/&#34;&gt;http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-08-github-pages-and-hugo/&lt;/a&gt;) I did not have the capability for people to leave comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Staticman comes in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I finally decided that I should have a crack at building one of Rob Mile&amp;rsquo;s Hull Pixel Bots (&lt;a href=&#34;http://hullpixelbot.com/&#34;&gt;http://hullpixelbot.com/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have completed the first step by printing out the plastic parts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I talked about Kingdomino and what the maximum possible score is in two player 7 x 7 grid mode is (&lt;a href=&#34;http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-14-ultimate-king-domino/)&#34;&gt;http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-14-ultimate-king-domino/)&lt;/a&gt;. I showed a possible contender (267 points) and asked whether you could do better, throwing down the gauntlet. Well I picked the gauntlet back up again and did better myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just a few days before last Christmas I began belatedly thinking about what sort of things I could do with my family during the holiday period. A little while ago, one of my buddies had introduced me to Kingdomino (&lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino&#34;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino&lt;/a&gt;) which is a fun tile placement game for up to 4 players. It was on &amp;lsquo;the list&amp;rsquo; of games that I had put together after perusing a number of sources on the internet for games that play well with three players. This is because my immediate family unit is made up of me, my wife, and our (currently) 9 year old son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that I was belatedly thinking about it because I started after even Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Christmas delivery cut off. This might be an obstacle for your average fellow, but armed with my 3D printer I was not deterred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So Three Thing Game (&lt;a href=&#34;http://threethinggame.com/post/2018-05-05-the-event/&#34;&gt;http://threethinggame.com/post/2018-05-05-the-event/&lt;/a&gt;) took place last weekend and much fun was had by all. That link was an article I wrote chronicling the event including all the winners. There were a number of other great games made that didn&amp;rsquo;t place and hopefully they will all make their own blog posts about it because this is my blog so I want to talk about the great game that I made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a post to proselytise the virtues of blogging with respect to getting your first job (and possibly ones to follow). I also want to reintroduce CSBlogs  &lt;a href=&#34;http://csblogs.com/&#34;&gt;http://csblogs.com/&lt;/a&gt; to the Hull Computer Science students. More on both below. The picture is unrelated but begs the question, Who&amp;rsquo;s a pretty tabby tiger?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Under a rock and hidden deep,
There lies a frog, he’s half asleep.
He dreams no dreams of kingdoms far,
But of being trapped inside a jar.
 He tossed and turned throughout the night,
Not cold, he shivered from his fright.
The jar was sealed, the air was thin,
Not much air was there within.
 So he gasped and strived for a breath,
And bravely waited for his death.</description>

      <description>If you want to get the first fault tree in my ExampleFaultTrees object, then the following code is for you:
var exampleFaultTrees = new ExampleFaultTrees(); topNode = exampleFaultTrees.getFaultTree(0); You first need to instantiate an ExampleFaultTrees object and then you can ask it for the zeroth element in its internal array of fault trees.
You can then simply call the topNode’s draw function, giving it the 2d context of the canvas as a parameter to draw to.</description>

Above is a rough video I put together of the content. I made it using a chemistry beaker holder to hold my webcam pointing down at the surface of my desk.</description>

      <description>Today I took possession of my shiny new Samsung Galaxy Note II.
My previous daily device was the Samsung Omnia 7 which was one of the debut devices of the Windows Phone 7 range. It was a close run race between the Note II and the flagship Windows Phone 8 device the Nokia Lumia 920.
I mentioned before that it was a close race with the Lumia phone. Both are large, flagship devices with the Lumia being widely lauded as having one of the best cameras on a mobile phone, the best in low light.</description>

      <description>This morning, some lovely person using the handle Burger commented on one of my earlier postssuggesting that if I connect the eGPU setup after boot-up is complete then I should get a significant boost due to PCIe compression. I little bit of Googling reveals a bit more detail here, but it seems that you need to have a ‘modern’ Intel integrated GPU in combination with one of a fairly narrow range of Nvidia kit.</description>

      <description>Today my new graphics card arrived from eBay. It is a second hand MSI N460GTX Hawkwhich I picked up for a reasonable £79.02 including postage. This puts the running total for the eGPU project (not including bits that I had lying around) at £166.10.
So how does it perform? Well you may remember that I previously benchmarkedboth the integrated graphics of my laptop and a borrowed Geforce 9600GT in the eGPU adapter with the eGPU providing a splendid 3 times increase in the 3DMark06 score.</description>

      <description>Well, I have done a spot of benchmarking. Specifically using 3DMark06 and the Resident Evil 5 benchmarking tool. If you are wondering what I am talking about here is an introductionand a follow-up.
I guess a brief recap wouldn’t be out of place. I have a laptop with integrated graphics. This severely limits the games that I can play. This makes me sad. I have read that I can put together an adapter that plugs in to the ExpressCard slot in my laptop that allows me to use a desktop GPU to power the graphics.</description>

      <description>Today (26th) the adapter parts for my eGPU project arrived from Taiwan. I paid for it on the 20th via PayPal and on the 24th the PayPal status was updated to let me know that my purchase had shipped with a DHL tracking number. I am pretty happy with the delivery time.
Something that I knew was a possibility, though was still slightly vexing, was an accompanying VAT charge from Customs amounting to £12.</description>

      <description>Though I like to think that my software development work shows a little artistry, I am certainly not an artist in the classical sense of the word. However, I have been developing an art project with artist Roberto Bono (Roberto’s website) for the past year or so, and as I have just uploaded a couple of new Roberto works I thought I would share them.
The ‘idea’ of the work is that is is comprised of 12 double sided paintings that form the whole.</description>

If you haven’t encountered such a thing before, it is a large maze that has been cut in to a field of growing corn (or maize to identify the pun). In order to add to the challenge and fun of the exploration there are, dotted about the maze, some boards with quiz questions. By collecting the correct answers you can decode the final board at the exit of the maze and enter your self in to their competition.</description>

      <description>This game was my first foray into Windows Phone 7 development. It is a Silverlight app based on the card game of Memory (as I knew it, though it is also known by many other names according to Wikipedia). The idea is that you turn over the ‘cards’ in pairs; if they match then you get to keep them. If they don’t match then they are flipped back over and you get another try.</description>

      <description>The PC that I use for work (and play) is a Toshiba Portégé R700-160 laptop. It is a delightfully sleek and portable device that packs a pretty decent Intel Core i5-520M Processor into its tiny chassis. A (perhaps unavoidable) weakness of the machine is its graphics capability as it relies on the integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD GPU. It can just about manage Civilization V but anything more graphically intensive is a shuddering no-no.</description>
