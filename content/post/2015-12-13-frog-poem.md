Under a rock and hidden deep,
  
There lies a frog, he’s half asleep.
  
He dreams no dreams of kingdoms far,
  
But of being trapped inside a jar.
  
&nbsp;
  
He tossed and turned throughout the night,
  
Not cold, he shivered from his fright.
  
The jar was sealed, the air was thin,
  
Not much air was there within.
  
&nbsp;
  
So he gasped and strived for a breath,
  
And bravely waited for his death.
  
Another breath he drew, his last.
  
Before his eyes there flashed his past.
  
&nbsp;
  
Startled now from sleep he woke,
  
Those aren’t the dreams for proper folk.
  
Thank god it’s all a dream, he said,
  
That I’m alive and am not dead.
  
&nbsp;
  
With a cheerful yawn then out he hopped,
  
Onto the road, and there was squashed.
  
This shows that though you dream of dread,
  
You are sometimes better off in bed.
