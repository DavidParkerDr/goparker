Today I have been frustrated by a perennial problem of mine which is forgetting to add a crucial file to source control. Consequently, a program that I had wanted to show off today won't build.

Luckily, it isn't a major problem as this isn't a missed deadline, but it easily could have been. This isn't the first time that this has happened to me and I have made this rookie mistake with many flavours of source control.

In fact, just to rub salt in the wound, I remember thinking before I left the house today, "should I make sure that all the files are committed?", and concluding that I was sure that I hadn't created any new files and so didn't need to bother.

Apparently this is another "do as I say, not what I do" moment as I have made it a point to include the advice to checkout your work in to an empty folder just to be sure on all my coursework specifications for a number of years now.
