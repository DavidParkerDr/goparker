Just a quick note for now to announce the publishing of our game â€“ Heartotron &#8211; to the Windows Store. You can preview and install it (for free!) on your Windows 8 device from the following store link:

<http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/heartotron/569d7e21-6eca-479c-8dfd-03371b5f739e>

Please give it a go and leave us some feedback or ideas for improvements. We have a planned update for later in the week to add new enemy types so watch this space.

We hope to deliver a Windows Phone 8 port soon, and later an Android and iOS release.

When you get a highscore, consider sharing it using the Share Charms. We have a Twitter account so throw in an @SpookyElephant and/or a #Heartotron.

We also have a Spooky Elephant Facebook page so why not join us for a chat about game enhancements.
