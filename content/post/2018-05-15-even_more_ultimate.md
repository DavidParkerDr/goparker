So yesterday I talked about Kingdomino and what the maximum possible score is in two player 7 x 7 grid mode is (http://goparker.com/post/2018-05-14-ultimate-king-domino/). I showed a possible contender (267 points) and asked whether you could do better, throwing down the gauntlet. Well I picked the gauntlet back up again and did better myself.

286 points! And here is the breakdown for the image shown above. I think this may be an actual maximum. I went through several iterations to get here.

| Colours        | Number of Tiles | Number of Spots | Total Points |
| -------------- |:---------------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Blue Squares   | 1 | 0 | 1 x 0 = 0 |
| Grey Circles   | 17 | 5 | 17 x 5 = 85 |
| Pink Triangles | 3 | 60 | 3 x 60 = 0 |
| Yellow Stars   | 12 | 6 | 12 x 6 = 72 |
| Green Crosses  | 9 | 6 | 9 x 6 = 54 |
| White Hearts   | 6  | 10 | 6 x 10 = 60 |
| Central Castle   |   |  | 10 |
| Used all tiles   |   |  | 5 |
| **total**   |   |  | 286 |

So I ask again: Can you do better? This time I carefully remove my glove before slapping it sharply across your cheek.
