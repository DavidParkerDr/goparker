      <description>If you want to get the first fault tree in my ExampleFaultTrees object, then the following code is for you:
var exampleFaultTrees = new ExampleFaultTrees(); topNode = exampleFaultTrees.getFaultTree(0);  You first need to instantiate an ExampleFaultTrees object and then you can ask it for the zeroth element in its internal array of fault trees.
You can then simply call the topNode&amp;#8217;s draw function, giving it the 2d context of the canvas as a parameter to draw to.</description>

      <description>The other day I gave a workshop for the 08240 2d Computer Graphics students in the Computer Science department of the University of Hull. A number of the students were struggling with this aspect of the coursework that they were undertaking.
Above is a rough video I put together of the content. I made it using a chemistry beaker holder to hold my webcam pointing down at the surface of my desk.</description>

      <title>My DIY eGPU Project – Speed boost</title>

      <description>This morning, some lovely person using the handle Burger commented on one of my earlier posts suggesting that if I connect the eGPU setup after boot-up is complete then I should get a significant boost due to PCIe compression. I little bit of Googling reveals a bit more detail here, but it seems that you need to have a ‘modern’ Intel integrated GPU in combination with one of a fairly narrow range of Nvidia kit.</description>

      <description>Today I spent the day a the Beverley Maze with The Wife, The Boy, and some friends. If you haven’t encountered such a thing before, it is a large maze that has been cut in to a field of growing corn (or maize to identify the pun). In order to add to the challenge and fun of the exploration there are, dotted about the maze, some boards with quiz questions. By collecting the correct answers you can decode the final board at the exit of the maze and enter your self in to their competition.</description>
