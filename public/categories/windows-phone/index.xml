      <description>Today I took possession of my shiny new Samsung Galaxy Note II.
My previous daily device was the Samsung Omnia 7 which was one of the debut devices of the Windows Phone 7 range. It was a close run race between the Note II and the flagship Windows Phone 8 device the Nokia Lumia 920.

      <description>This game was my first foray into Windows Phone 7 development. It is a Silverlight app based on the card game of Memory (as I knew it, though it is also known by many other names according to Wikipedia). The idea is that you turn over the &amp;#8216;cards&amp;#8217; in pairs; if they match then you get to keep them. If they don&amp;#8217;t match then they are flipped back over and you get another try.</description>
