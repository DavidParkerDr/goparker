      <description>Though I like to think that my software development work shows a little artistry, I am certainly not an artist in the classical sense of the word. However, I have been developing an art project with artist Roberto Bono (Roberto&amp;#8217;s website) for the past year or so, and as I have just uploaded a couple of new Roberto works I thought I would share them.
The ‘idea’ of the work is that is is comprised of 12 double sided paintings that form the whole.</description>

      <description>This game was my first foray into Windows Phone 7 development. It is a Silverlight app based on the card game of Memory (as I knew it, though it is also known by many other names according to Wikipedia). The idea is that you turn over the &amp;#8216;cards&amp;#8217; in pairs; if they match then you get to keep them. If they don&amp;#8217;t match then they are flipped back over and you get another try.</description>
