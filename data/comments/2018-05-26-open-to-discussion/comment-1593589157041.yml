The host of any heist doesn’t make any money during setup missions and has to spend money to start each, so it's a good idea for the host to take 40% (4 players)/50% (3 players)/60% (2 players) of the final heist earnings with other players taking an equal share of what remains, so that all players will earn approximately the same overall. Paying to skip prep missions is almost always never worth it from a monetary or time perspective.\r\nThink about it… when you look at these lengthy books that are nearly the size of your head, how motivated do you feel to read that?\r\n100–300pcs for really cheap products (less than a dollar)\r\nRent your driveway for up to ?200/mth.
